# 📂 Work Log: Differential Expression Analysis (Krt8 ADI vs AT2)

**Date:** 2026-01-17  
**Author:** Nora  
**Script:** `03_scripts_runs/03_DEG_analysis.R`  
**Data Source:** GSE141259 (Mouse Lung Fibrosis Model)

---

## 🎯 1. Objective
To identify the molecular mechanisms driving the transition from healthy **AT2 cells** to the pathological **Krt8 ADI (Alveolar Differentiation Intermediate)** state. Specifically, to find Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) that characterize the "dedifferentiation" and "stress response" process.

## 🛠️ 2. Workflow
* **Data Loading:** Loaded the processed Seurat object (`lung_obj_final_analysis.rds`).
* **Set Identity:** Switched active identity to `cell.type`.
* **DEG Calculation:** Used `FindMarkers()` to compare `Krt8 ADI` (Group 1) vs `AT2 cells` (Group 2).
* **Visualization:** Generated Volcano Plots and UMAP Feature Plots to validate findings spatially.

## 🧬 3. Key Biological Findings

Through statistical analysis and spatial visualization, three key dimensions of the Krt8 ADI cell state were identified:

### A. Identity Switch
* **Loss of AT2 Marker:** `Sftpc` (Surfactant Protein C) was significantly **downregulated** (Log2FC ≈ -2.5), indicating a loss of normal alveolar function (Dedifferentiation).
* **Gain of Injury Marker:** `Krt8` (Cytokeratin 8) was significantly **upregulated** (Log2FC ≈ 3.16), serving as the distinct marker for this injury-associated cell state.

### B. Cellular Senescence
* **Cycle Arrest:** `Cdkn1a` (p21) was highly upregulated (Top 10 upregulated genes). This suggests the cells are locked in a senescent state (cell cycle arrest) and unable to complete regeneration.

### C. Stress Response
* **High Stress Level:** `S100a6` and `Clu` (Clusterin) showed the most dramatic upregulation (Log2FC > 5). This reflects an intense survival response to tissue injury.

## 📊 4. Visual Evidence

| Plot Type | Filename | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Volcano Plot** | `lianxixi_Volcano_Krt8_Final.png` | Highlights the global shift: Sftpc (Left/Down) vs Krt8/S100a6/Cdkn1a (Right/Up). |
| **Feature Plot** | `lianxixi_FeaturePlot_KeyGenes.png` | Spatial confirmation: `Krt8` expression is exclusive to the specific "bridge" population where `Sftpc` expression is lost, co-localizing perfectly with stress markers `S100a6` and `Cdkn1a`. |

## 📝 5. Conclusion
The analysis confirms that **Krt8 ADI cells** are not merely "different" AT2 cells, but a distinct, pathological cell state characterized by **dedifferentiation (loss of Sftpc)**, **senescence (Cdkn1a)**, and **high stress (S100a6)**. They represent a "stalled" regeneration intermediate in lung fibrosis.

# 🧬 Work Log: Functional Enrichment Analysis (GO:BP)

**Date:** 2026-01-19  
**Author:** Nora  
**Script:** `03_scripts_runs/04_Enrichment_analysis.R`  
**Input Data:** Up-regulated DEGs from Krt8 ADI cells (vs AT2)

## 🎯 1. Objective
To decode the functional state of **Krt8 ADI cells** by mapping the previously identified up-regulated genes (e.g., *Krt8*, *S100a6*, *Clu*) to biological pathways using Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. We aim to answer: "What are these damaged cells actively *doing*?"

## 🛠️ 2. Methodology
* **Filtering:** Selected significant up-regulated genes (`adj.P.Val < 0.05` & `log2FC > 0.5`) from the DEG table.
* **Annotation:** Converted Gene Symbols to Entrez IDs using `org.Mm.eg.db`.
* **Enrichment:** Performed GO Biological Process (BP) enrichment using `clusterProfiler::enrichGO`.
* **Visualization:** Generated a Dotplot to visualize the top 15 most significant pathways.

## 🧬 3. Key Findings
The analysis reveals that Krt8 ADI cells are metabolically hyper-active despite being cell-cycle arrested.

### A. Hyper-Biosynthesis
* **Top Terms:** `cytoplasmic translation`, `ribosome biogenesis`, `translation at synapse`.
* **Interpretation:** The most significant function is **protein synthesis**. This explains the high expression of structural proteins (*Krt8*) and stress-response proteins (*S100a6*, *Clu*) identified in the previous step. The cells are effectively "factories" running at full capacity to produce survival factors.

### B. High Metabolic Demand
* **Key Terms:** `aerobic respiration`, `oxidative phosphorylation`, `ATP synthesis`.
* **Interpretation:** The protein synthesis machinery requires immense energy. The enrichment of respiratory pathways confirms that these cells are burning fuel (ATP) aggressively to maintain their "stalled" but highly active stress state.

## 📊 4. Visual Evidence

| Plot Type | Filename | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dotplot** | `GO_Enrichment_Dotplot.png` | Shows the top enriched biological processes. The dominance of "Translation" (Red/Large bubbles) provides strong evidence for the high-biosynthetic state of Krt8 ADI cells. |

## 📝 5. Integrated Conclusion
Combining the DEG results (Jan 17) with today's Enrichment results (Jan 19):
**Krt8 ADI cells** are defined by a paradox:
1.  **Stalled Growth:** They are not dividing (high *Cdkn1a*).
2.  **Hyper-Active Metabolism:** They are actively synthesizing proteins and generating ATP (GO results).
This confirms they are in a **Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP)-like state**, prioritizing survival and stress signaling over regeneration.

# 🧬 Work Log: Trajectory & Pseudotime Analysis (Monocle3)

**Date:** 2026-01-26  
**Author:** Nora  
**Script:** `05_Trajectory_Analysis.R`  
**Input Data:** Seurat Object (`lung_obj_final_analysis.rds`) - Subset of AT2 & ADI lineages.

---

## 🎯 1. Objective

To reconstruct the continuous developmental trajectory of alveolar regeneration and quantify the transdifferentiation process from healthy **AT2 cells** to the injury-induced **Krt8+ ADI** state.
We aim to answer: *"Is there a continuous path connecting these two states, and what are the driver genes orchestrating this transition?"*

---

## 🛠️ 2. Methodology

The analysis was performed using **Monocle3** with the following key steps:

* **Data Structure Conversion:** Successfully converted the Seurat object to Monocle3 `cell_data_set` (CDS).
    * *Correction:* Manually transferred `cell_type` metadata to resolve the ID matching error.
* **Trajectory Inference:** Learned the principal graph on the UMAP embedding.
    * *Result:* A continuous "main path" was identified connecting the AT2 cluster to the ADI cluster.
* **Pseudotime Calculation:**
    * Defined the **Root Node** based on the highest density of `AT2 cells`.
    * Calculated pseudotime values for all cells (0 = Start/AT2, >50 = End/ADI).
* **Driver Gene Identification:**
    * Used **Moran’s I test** (`graph_test`) to find genes with spatially coherent expression along the trajectory.
    * Grouped these genes into **Co-expression Modules** to identify the ADI-specific gene signature.

---

## 🧬 3. Key Findings

### A. Confirmation of Lineage Plasticity
The trajectory analysis confirms a direct, continuous lineage relationship between AT2 cells and Krt8 ADI cells. The process is not discrete but shows a gradual transition, supporting the hypothesis of **AT2-to-ADI transdifferentiation**.

### B. Pseudotime Gradient
* **Early Phase:** Corresponds to naive AT2 cells (High expression of surfactant genes).
* **Late Phase:** Corresponds to the Krt8 ADI state, characterized by the loss of AT2 identity and acquisition of a stress/injury phenotype.

### C. Identification of the "ADI Module"
We successfully identified a specific gene module that is sharply upregulated at the trajectory terminus (ADI state).
* **Key Markers identified:** `Krt8`, `Krt19`, `Lgals3`.
* **Biological Implication:** This module represents the core transcriptional machinery driving the injury response and preventing re-differentiation (the "stalled" state).

# 📅 2026-01-27: Functional Enrichment Analysis (GO Terms)

**Script:** `06_Module_Enrichment.R`
**Input Data:** `Krt8_ADI_Module_Genes.csv` (The target gene list identified in Step 05)
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## 🎯 1. Objective
To decode the biological function of the "Krt8 ADI Module".
We know *which* genes are in this module (e.g., *Krt8*, *Lgals3*), but we need to understand *what* cellular processes they orchestrate.
* **Question:** Are these cells dying? Proliferating? Or differentiating?

## 🛠️ 2. Methodology
* **Tool:** `clusterProfiler` (R package).
* **Database:** `org.Mm.eg.db` (Mouse Genome).
* **Analysis Type:** Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment - **Biological Process (BP)**.
* **Process:**
    1.  Converted Gene Symbols to Entrez IDs.
    2.  Performed enrichment test (p-value cutoff < 0.05).
    3.  Visualized top 15 enriched terms using a **Dotplot**.

## 🧬 3. Key Findings
The analysis reveals a distinct "Reprogramming & Repair" signature:

1.  **Squamous Metaplasia:**
    * **Top Terms:** `epidermis development`, `skin development`.
    * **Interpretation:** The lung AT2 cells are adopting "skin-like" properties (expression of Keratins). This is a classic stress response to thicken the alveolar barrier and protect against injury (forming a "callus").
2.  **Barrier Reconstruction:**
    * **Top Terms:** `tight junction assembly`, `cell-cell junction organization`.
    * **Interpretation:** The cells are actively building connections to seal the injured alveoli and prevent leakage.
3.  **Regenerative Potential :**
    * **Top Terms:** `lung morphogenesis`, `epithelial tube branching`.
    * **Interpretation:** Despite the injury phenotype, the cells retain the developmental memory required to regenerate lung structure.

## 📊 4. Output Files
* 🖼️ **Visualization:** `Krt8_Module_GO_Enrichment.png` (The Dotplot).
* 📋 **Full Table:** `Krt8_Module_GO_Table.csv` (Detailed statistics for all terms).

> **Conclusion:** The Krt8 ADI state represents a **"Barrier-Strengthening & Repair"** phase, characterized by the transient activation of epidermal programs to survive acute injury.

# 📅 2026-01-27: Pseudotime Expression Kinetics (Gene Trends)

**Script:** `07_Gene_Trends.R`
**Input Data:** `lung_monocle_final.rds`
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## 🎯 1. Objective
To visualize the dynamic expression changes of specific marker genes along the inferred trajectory.
We aim to validate the identity switch from AT2 to ADI at the single-gene level: *"Do AT2 markers actually drop? Do ADI markers actually rise?"*

## 🛠️ 2. Methodology
* **Function:** `monocle3::plot_genes_in_pseudotime`.
* **Target Genes Selected:**
    * **AT2 Lineage:** *Sftpc, Sftpb* (Surfactant proteins).
    * **ADI/Injury Lineage:** *Krt8, Krt19, Lgals3* (Stress markers).
    * **Proliferation:** *Mki67* (Cell cycle marker).
* **Visualization:** Modeled expression trends (black lines) overlaid on single-cell expression values (colored dots).

## 🧬 3. Key Findings
The kinetic plots reveal distinct expression patterns confirming the transdifferentiation model:

1.  **Loss of AT2 Identity (Sftpc/Sftpb):**
    * **Trend:** Sharp, monotonic decrease along pseudotime.
    * **Meaning:** Cells rapidly silence their surfactant production programs upon injury.
2.  **Gain of Injury State (Krt8/Krt19):**
    * **Trend:** While the smoothed average line remains low (due to zero-inflation/dropout), a distinct sub-population of cells at the terminus (Yellow phase) shows high expression (dots > 3.0).
    * **Meaning:** A specific subset of cells successfully acquires the ADI phenotype.
3.  **Transient Driver (Lgals3):**
    * **Trend:** Strong, bell-shaped upregulation during the intermediate phase.
    * **Meaning:** *Lgals3* appears to be a robust driver activated during the transition process.
4.  **No Proliferation (Mki67):**
    * **Trend:** Flat/Low expression throughout.
    * **Meaning:** Confirms the ADI state is a result of direct conversion (transdifferentiation) without active cell division (cell cycle arrest).

## 📊 4. Output Files
* 🖼️ **Trend Plot:** `Monocle3_Gene_Trends_LinePlot.png` (Visualization of the 6 key genes).

> **Conclusion:** The gene kinetics provide molecular evidence for the AT2-to-ADI transition, characterized by the synchronized downregulation of homeostatic genes and upregulation of stress-response genes.

# 📅 2026-02-02: Cell-Cell Communication Inference (Global Network)

**Script:** `08_CellChat_Analysis.R`
**Input Data:** `lung_obj_final_analysis.rds` (Seurat Object)
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## 🎯 1. Objective
To infer the intercellular communication network governing the lung injury response.
We aim to move beyond single-cell identify (AT2 vs. ADI) and understand the **social network** of the tissue: *"Who is signaling to whom during the regeneration process?"*

## 🛠️ 2. Methodology
* **Tool:** `CellChat` (v1.x).
* **Database:** `CellChatDB.mouse` (Full database).
* **Process:**
    1.  **Preprocessing:** Identified over-expressed ligands and receptors in each cell group.
    2.  **Inference:** Computed communication probabilities using the `triMean` method.
    3.  **Aggregation:** Aggregated all L-R pairs to visualize the total communication flow.

## 🧬 3. Key Findings
* **High Connectivity:** The global network reveals a dense, complex web of interactions (the "Hairball" phenotype), indicating robust cross-talk between Epithelial (AT2/ADI), Immune (Macrophages), and Stromal (Fibroblasts) compartments.
* **Distinction:**
    * **Number Plot:** Shows potential connectivity bandwidth (how many pathways are available).
    * **Weight Plot:** Shows actual signaling intensity (how active these pathways are).

# 📅 2026-02-02 (Part 2): Ligand-Receptor Specifics (Zoom-in Analysis)

**Script:** `08_CellChat_Analysis.R` (Part 2)
**Status:** ✅ Completed

## 🎯 1. Objective
To decode the specific molecular signals driving the AT2-to-ADI transition.
Instead of looking at the global network, we perform a directed analysis to answer two specific questions:
1.  **Incoming:** What signals from the microenvironment are "bullying" AT2 cells?
2.  **Outgoing:** What pathogenic signals are Krt8 ADI cells spreading to their neighbors?

## 🛠️ 2. Methodology
* **Visualization:** `netVisual_bubble` (Bubble Plots).
* **Strategy:**
    * **Input Analysis:** Targets restricted to "AT2 cells".
    * **Output Analysis:** Sources restricted to "Krt8 ADI".
* **Key Metrics:** Ligand-Receptor pairs plotted by communication probability (bubble size) and expression level (color).

## 🧬 3. Key Findings

### A. Environment Stress on AT2 (Incoming)
* **Key Signal:** `Fn1 - Sdc4` (Fibronectin - Syndecan-4).
* **Senders:** Fibroblasts, Myofibroblasts, and Fn1+ Macrophages.
* **Interpretation:** AT2 cells are being subjected to intense **Extracellular Matrix (ECM) signaling**. The high interaction with Fibronectin (`Fn1`) suggests that **mechanical stress/stiffening** of the niche is a primary driver forcing AT2 cells to lose their identity and undergo reprogramming.

### B. Pro-inflammatory Feedback by ADI (Outgoing)
* **Key Signals:** `Mif - (Cd74+...)` and `Spp1 - Cd44`.
* **Receivers:** Macrophages (AM, M2) and Proliferating cells.
* **Interpretation:** The Krt8 ADI state is not passive. It actively secretes potent pro-inflammatory mediators:
    * **MIF** (Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor): Keeps immune cells trapped and active in the injury site.
    * **SPP1** (Osteopontin): A known driver of fibrosis and inflammation.
    * **Conclusion:** ADI cells create a **pathogenic feed-forward loop**, preventing inflammation resolution.

## 📊 4. Output Files
* 🖼️ `CellChat_Incoming_AT2.png`: Shows the fibrotic signals received by AT2.
* 🖼️ `CellChat_Outgoing_ADI.png`: Shows the inflammatory signals sent by ADI.

> **Summary:** The analysis identifies the **Fn1-Sdc4 axis** as a potential upstream trigger for AT2 injury, and the **Mif/Spp1 axis** as a downstream consequence of the ADI state.

> **Next Step:** Perform "Sender/Receiver" analysis to specifically zoom in on signals received by AT2 cells (Input) and signals sent by Krt8 ADI cells (Output).


# 📅 2026-02-07 (Part 3): Transcription Factor Analysis (The "Master Regulators")

**Script:** `09_TF_Analysis_decoupleR.R` (Final AutoFix Version)
**Status:** ✅ Completed (High Difficulty)

## 🎯 1. Objective
To move beyond gene expression and identify the **upstream Transcription Factors (TFs)** controlling the AT2-to-ADI transition. We aim to find the "bosses" (TFs) in the nucleus that are orchestrating the reprogramming process.

## 🛠️ 2. Methodology
* **Tool:** `decoupleR` (R package for footprint analysis).
* **Algorithm:** `run_ulm` (Univariate Linear Model) for fast and robust inference.
* **Database:** `DoRothEA` (High-confidence TF-Target interactome).
* **Process:**
    * Inferred TF activity scores based on the aggregate expression of downstream target genes.
    * **Troubleshooting:** Overcame persistent "cell name mismatch" errors by implementing a robust renaming strategy (renaming all cells to `C1`, `C2`...) to ensure 100% matrix alignment.

## 🧬 3. Key Findings

### A. The Mastermind of Reprogramming
* **Key TF:** **Sox9**.
* **Observation:** Shows peak activity (deep red) specifically in `Krt8 ADI` cells, while silent in normal AT2 cells.
* **Interpretation:** **Sox9** is confirmed as the master regulator forcing AT2 cells to lose their identity and acquire a progenitor-like state.

### B. The Stress Signal (The Trigger)
* **Key TFs:** **Atf6** and **Hsf1**.
* **Observation:** Highly upregulated activity in the ADI population.
* **Interpretation:** Markers of **ER Stress (Unfolded Protein Response)**. This suggests that proteotoxic stress is a primary driver or consequence of the transition.

### C. The Fibrosis Architects (EMT)
* **Key TF:** **Twist1**.
* **Interpretation:** **Twist1** is a classic driver of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). Its activation indicates AT2 cells are acquiring fibroblast-like properties, contributing to fibrosis.

### D. The Inflammatory Thugs
* **Key TFs:** **Junb**, **Fosl1** (AP-1 family).
* **Interpretation:** Indicates a strong pro-inflammatory transcriptional program is active within the transitioning cells.

## 📊 4. Output Files
* 🖼️ `TF_Activity_Heatmap.png`: Heatmap visualizing the inferred activity of the top differential TFs across all cell types.

> **Summary:** The analysis successfully identifies the **Sox9-Twist1-Atf6 axis** as the core regulatory network. Injury triggers **ER Stress (Atf6)**, which activates **Sox9** for reprogramming and **Twist1** for fibrosis.

**Next Step:** Perform Pathway Activity Analysis (PROGENy/UCell) to score specific biological processes (e.g., Hypoxia, TGF-b signaling) across the trajectory.


# 📅 2026-02-07 (Part 4): Pathway Activity Scoring (UCell)

**Script:** `10_Pathway_Scoring_UCell.R`
**Status:** ✅ SUCCEEDED (Dependencies fixed via BiocManager)

## 🎯 1. Objective
To quantify specific biological states (Senescence, EMT, Hypoxia) across cell types, specifically asking: *"How 'stressed' are the ADI cells compared to normal AT2?"*

## 🛠️ 2. Methodology
* **Tool:** `UCell` (Rank-based scoring, robust to batch effects).
* **Gene Sets:**
    * **ADI Signature:** (Krt8, Cldn4...) - Positive control.
    * **EMT:** (Vim, Fn1, Twist1...) - Fibrosis indicator.
    * **Senescence:** (Cdkn2a, Il6...) - Aging/SASP indicator.
    * **Hypoxia:** (Hif1a, Vegfa...) - Metabolic stress.

## 🧬 3. Key Findings (from Violin Plots)
* **Validation:** Fibroblasts showed the highest **EMT scores**, validating the gene set accuracy.
* **The ADI Phenotype:**
    * **Partial EMT:** Krt8 ADI cells exhibit significantly higher EMT scores than AT2 cells, confirming their transition towards a mesenchymal state.
    * **Senescence & Hypoxia:** ADI cells are distinctively marked by high Hypoxia and Senescence scores, suggesting they are "stuck" in a stressed, non-regenerative state.
    * **Inflammation:** High inflammatory scores align with the previous CellChat finding (Mif/Spp1 secretion).

## 📊 4. Output Files
* 🖼️ `Pathway_UCell_Violin.png`: Shows the stepwise elevation of stress markers from AT2 -> ADI.
* 🖼️ `Pathway_UCell_UMAP.png`: Visualizes the spatial restriction of these states.

> **Conclusion:** The AT2-to-ADI transition is not just a change in markers (Krt8+), but a fundamental shift in cell state involving **metabolic reprogramming (Hypoxia)**, **cell cycle arrest (Senescence)**, and **fibrogenic activation (EMT)**.
